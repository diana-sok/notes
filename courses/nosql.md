# NoSQL

## CAP Theorem
States no distributed system can strongly support more than 2 of the three
> **C**onsistency - system appears as a single node (every read returns the
 most recent write)
>
> **A**vailability - all non-failing nodes can be written/read from
>
> **P**artition Tolerance - system will function in spite of network partition

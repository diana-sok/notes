## CAP Theorem

> **P**artition Tolerance

* In relation to distributed systems
* States no distributed system can strongly support more than 2 of the three:
* **Consistency** - system appears as a single node (every read returns the
 most recent write)
* **Availability** - all non-failing nodes can be written/read from
* **Partition Tolerance** - system will function in spite of network partition
